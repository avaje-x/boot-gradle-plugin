# boot-gradle-plugin

This is an `extraction / copy / rip-off` of the Spring boot gradle plugin focusing on the `Repackaging` *task only*.

The original code is at: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-plugin

This plugin has removed the `Agent`, `Dependency Management` and `Run` features with the view that we really only want
to repackage our Jar/War into runnable Jars using `spring-boot-loader-tools`.
